During her lecture ‚Relationship networks‘, Lada Nakonechna will share her artistic approaches towards issues of the past. The presentation will be based on her recent projects and collaborations dealing with problems of the creation, displaying, and function of art of the socialist period in Ukraine. Lada Nakonechna’s latest investigations of the institutional and educational system of ‚Socialist Realism‘ understood as a ‚method‘ are based on artistic and archival materials and focusing on landscapes, a genre that contemporary Ukrainian art history often positions as ‚ideologically harmless‘.

The workshop following the lecture will involve participants using artistic means and group work to uncover networks that produce various forms of violence. The material for expression will be a found material in three possible organizational forms: Flat screen, moving image, spatial installation. The participants deal artistically with the question of how violence can be depicted without reproducing violent images.

Lada Nakonechna is an artist and researcher. She is involved in a number of group projects and collectives, among them is the Method Fund she cofounded in 2015 and is currently co-curator of its educational and research programs. In 2016 she joined the new editorial board of Prostory.net.ua, an online magazine of art, literature and politics. Nakonechna presented her work at numerous international and Ukrainian exhibitions. She lives and works in Kyiv, Ukraine.

The events are a cooperation of the HGB Academy for transcultural Exchange ATA (organized by Melina Weisseborn) and the class Expanded Cinema, Prof. Clemens von Wedemeyer & Mareike Bernien PhD.

With the support of the Office for International Affairs of the City of Leipzig, for whom the artist is currently conducting the research project „Collecting Surfaces“ in Leipzig.
