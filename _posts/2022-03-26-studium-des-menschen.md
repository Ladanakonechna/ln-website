**Studium des Menschen** <br>
Galerie EIGEN + ART Leipzig<br>
March 26, 2022 - April 24, 2022
<br>
The classic training in painting and drawing at the National
Academy of Visual Arts Kyiv comprises the study of the human
body using the example of ancient sculptures. Their standard
bodily proportions should train the artistic gaze in the ability to
transpose what is seen into a depiction of the human being.
Students learn based on uniform, supposedly universal and
timeless male bodies, not on particular bodies or those marked by
history and the present. From each of these objects of study, Lada
Nakonechna molded one body part, the knee, in paper mâché.
