**The Attentive Museum—Permeable Practices for a Common Ground** <br>
СIMAM 2022 Annual Conference<br>
11.—13.11.2022<br>
Es Baluard Museu d’Art Contemporani de Palma, Mallorca, Spain 


From November 11–13, 2022, CIMAM will hold the 54th edition of its Annual Conference in the archipelago of the Balearic Islands, between Africa, Europe and the Middle East, to explore how museums can actively embrace, partner, and actively listen. It will also claim the urgency for museums to adapt and become spaces of shared encounter and hospitality, allowing themselves to be a permeable and vulnerable community capable of embodying multiple bodies; institutional, political, social, human, or non-human. 

The 12 speakers will reflect on the concept of The Attentive Museum and propose different models that can provide a roadmap for institutions through an exploration of new models of governance, and narratives of decolonial discourses, concluding with a vision beyond the museum world to collectives and new institutional models from which we can learn a more sustainable future.
