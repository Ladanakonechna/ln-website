The romantic pictures with ruins are the famous images telling us
about the entropy, revenge of nature over culture. But ruins on this
images are made by culture itself, the culture that is constantly
producing ruins.
In the series of drawings of Nakonechna, as in the romantic pictures,
the ruins are placed in a centre, not removed from the field of view
as important artefacts. This ruins are not a remnants evidencing past
epochs, establishing the cultural bond of the past with nowadays, but
of contemporary state of cultural dominance over the nature. This
certain ruins are unknown formations which detected in the center of
history of Ukraine.
