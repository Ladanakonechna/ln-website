Lada Nakonechna is author of drawings, public space actions, installations, videos and performances. She builds her multipartite installations and arranges her objects in a specific way so that they integrate the whole space, including the visitors in that space. The artist’s interest is in the structure of social relationships, the mutual dependence between acting and viewing and the perceptions and roles of art in them. She creates “spaces of the possible” in the territory of art, in which these relations can develop, reveal themselves, and clarify themselves. 

Lada Nakonechna is an artist but also curator (member of curatorial and activist union Hudrada, from 2008) and educator (co-founder, together with Kateryna Badianova, of the Course of Art - an independent educational program in Kyiv, from 2012). She is co-founder of the Method Fund (2015) and editor of PROSTORY - the journal of art, literature and politics.
Since 2005 Nakonechna is a member of the R.E.P. (Revolutionary Experimental Space) group, an artists' collective interested in the process of community building and in shaping a generation of engaged Ukrainian artists. Together with R.E.P., she works with the social space of post-Soviet countries as a mirror of European processes, and deals with questions of personal responsibility and civic patriotism, examines the interaction of the individual and the common, and explores the role of the artist and art institution in contemporary Ukraine
