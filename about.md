Lada Nakonechna is an artist and a researcher. 
As a collaboration oriented, she is involved in a number of artists, curatorial and research projects, and collectives. Since 2005 she is a member of R.E.P. (Revolutionary Experimental Space) group, an artists' collective interested in the process of community building and in shaping a generation of engaged Ukrainian artists. She also works as a curator being a member of curatorial and activist union Hudrada (from 2008) and as educator. 
As a leader of a Kyiv independent educational program Course of Art, which investigates through experience various ways to study and practice art nowadays, she is a mentor for the socially aware artists. Nakonechna co-founded the Method Fund in 2015—an independent, nonprofit organization aimed at supporting and developing contemporary art and culture in Ukraine by initiating scientific, educational and exhibition projects. She is interested in art as a communal activity and fragile instrument for social change.
