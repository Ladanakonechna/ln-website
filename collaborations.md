The **R.E.P.** group **(Revolutionary Experimental Space)** was established at the end of 2004 during the Orange Revolution in Ukraine. The group initially comprised 20 artists. Since 2006 the R.E.P. group’s members are **Ksenia Hnylytska, Nikita Kadan, Lesia Khomenko, Volodymyr Kuznetsov, Zhanna Kadyrova, Lada Nakonechna**. Their work began with a series of actions united by the name *Intervention*, which appeared as a reaction to the politicized public space of “post-orange” Ukraine. The group’s subsequent activity has focused on long-term serial projects. 

In their work, the R.E.P. group addresses a number of themes that are variously symptomatic of the current state of Ukrainian society – in its relations with the rest of the world and its internal problematics, which are considered universally. These include labor migration and the state of post-Soviet cultural institutions; social stratification and shared mythical images of prosperity; Soviet heritage and the simulation of Westernization, as in *Eurorenovation*; popular demand for a certain type of art and the individual responsibility of the artist. In recent years the group’s practice has involved conceptualizing its existence as a community. In 2006 the group organized a number of exhibitions, and in 2008 it launched the curatorial and activist union *Hudrada* (Artistic Committee).
