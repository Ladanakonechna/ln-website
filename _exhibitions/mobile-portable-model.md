For her exhibition, Lada Nakonechna places a tower construction in the middle of the gallery space. From it, as if from a lighthouse or a watchtower, a beam of light falls onto the surrounding walls of the darkened room. At the level of the illumination, the viewer can decipher text noted on the walls in pencil. But to do so, they are blinded and caught by the light, and must move with the light to grasp everything. The lighthouse is actually a symbol of a firm hold, a glimmer of hope on the horizon, towards which one orients oneself when having lost the way. In contrast, the watchtower with its spotlight can destroy such hopes in a flash. With the lighthouse/watchtower, the blinding light that blocks one’s view is the basis for the manipulation and perception of space between the artist, the visitor, and the exhibition space. What is really there, and what is imagination? Where does the path, which is shown by the light, lead? And how promising can the prospect be when the light is simultaneously shut in by four high walls that block the
view?
